# Info

This app will be created for a final project in a Programming 2 class. It will be a 2D videogame more specifically I'm thinking of doing a strategy game with rpg elements. It will use C# as the main programming language as it is the language the engine uses. I have completed two courses using C#, so I already know a thing or two, so heopefully it won't be too painfully challenging. I'm not very sure how unity engine works but once I do I'll start uploading files.
